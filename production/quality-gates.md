# 🚦 Quality Gate System

**CRITICAL:** Do not proceed past any gate until ALL criteria are met.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Quality gates prevent:
- Wasted time on bad foundations
- Batch-producing low-quality content
- Discovering problems after 20 hours of work
- Needing to redo entire batches

**Rule:** It's better to spend 2 hours fixing issues early than 20 hours redoing everything.

   - Not funny → rethink concept/execution
   - Too slow → optimize workflow

2. **Fix and retest:**
   - Don't proceed to full production
   - Adjust tools/workflow
   - Create 3 NEW test videos
   - Test again

3. **Only proceed when:**
   - Videos meet quality standards
   - Production time is reasonable
   - People genuinely want to share them
